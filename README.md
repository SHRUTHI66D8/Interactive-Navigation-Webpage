Task 1: Creating an Interactive Navigation Web Page

As part of my internship, I successfully completed Task 1, which involved designing and implementing an interactive navigation menu for a web page. This project required a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Steps Taken:
HTML Structure:

I started by creating the basic structure of the navigation menu using HTML.

The menu consisted of links to different sections such as Home, About, Services, and Contact.

CSS Styling:

To ensure the menu was visually appealing, I styled it using CSS.

I set the menu to have a fixed position at the top of the page, making it always visible as users scroll.

I included hover effects to enhance user experience, changing the background color of the menu items when hovered over.

JavaScript Interactivity:

To add interactivity, I used JavaScript to detect when the user scrolls down the page.

When the page is scrolled, the background color of the navigation bar changes, indicating a different state and improving user navigation.

Testing and Debugging:

I thoroughly tested the navigation menu across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Debugging was performed to address any inconsistencies or issues that arose during testing.

Outcome:
The interactive navigation menu enhanced the overall user experience by providing a seamless and visually engaging way for users to navigate the web page. This task allowed me to strengthen my skills in web development and gain practical experience in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
